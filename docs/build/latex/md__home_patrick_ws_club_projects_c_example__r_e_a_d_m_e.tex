This is just a basic example project so you can see how you would set up documentation and C\+Make.

This is so I don\textquotesingle{}t need to answer 1000 questions on how to structure your projects, build docs, or how to test \+:)


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Documentation\+: Sphinx \& Breathe
\item Build\+: C\+Make
\item Test\+: T\+BD
\end{DoxyItemize}

At a low level you need to do two things.

Tell C\+Make where your files are, and tell it where and how you want it built

For example for this project uses ninja in debug, and Unix Makefiles for the release. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd c\_example}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#Setup debug build dir}
\DoxyCodeLine{Cmake -\/G Ninja -\/S . -\/B build/debug}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#Setup release build dir}
\DoxyCodeLine{Cmake -\/G "Unix Makefiles" -\/S . -\/B build/release}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#Build debug directory}
\DoxyCodeLine{Cmake -\/-\/build build/debug}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#Build release directory}
\DoxyCodeLine{Cmake -\/-\/build build/release}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#Clean debug directory then build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build build/debug/ -\/-\/clean-\/first}
\end{DoxyCode}


To run the tests I have set up in this directory 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#For example to test the debug release}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build/debug}
\DoxyCodeLine{ctest}
\end{DoxyCode}


one will fail and one will succeed. It\textquotesingle{}s as simple as an assert statement and returning zero if it succeeds.

To build the docs you\textquotesingle{}ll need Doxygen 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt install doxygen}
\end{DoxyCode}
